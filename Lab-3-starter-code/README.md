# Lab 3: Overview and Rubric

In this lab, you will have the opportunity to construct styled tables and forms as well as sending test data to a test server target.  The goal is to style your web page so it appears similar to the image provided in the lab.  Detailed instructions can be found in the insructions pdf file.  Review the marking rubric to ensure you have addressed all points required for the page.  Ensure you keep a version on your page under version control as it will be used in subsequent weeks.  You do not need to use a webserver to host your page for this lab but will need internet connectivity to test your form.
